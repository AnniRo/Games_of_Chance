# Games_of_Chance

In this project, I created some functions that simulate four games of chance:
- flip coin --> The player calls "Heads" or "Tails".
- cho-han --> Rolling two dice and the player predicts whether the sum of those dice is odd or even and wins if the prediction is correct.
- pick a card --> Two players (user/computer) pick a card in random. The highest card wins.
- roulette

The player starts with a default amount of money (100). Then, the player is asked to pick one of the games above and to bet a portion of his/her money.
